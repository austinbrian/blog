      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/03/27/dc-dogs/">&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re at a local dog park in DC, and you see a dog chasing a ball, doing dog things, and you want to call out for her to come play with you. What should you yell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try “Lady” or “Blue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C77GgWCW0AAAHqi.jpg:large&quot; alt=&quot;Peanut! from @darth&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a list of 1,533 dog registrations in the District in 2016, those are most likely names for female and male dogs, respectively. Here are other common pup names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Good Boys&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Good Girls&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;#&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Blue&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lady&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;King&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Chloe&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Rocky&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Bella&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Charlie&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sheba&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Nino&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Princess&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Max&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Lola&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Zeus&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Sasha&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rambo, my favorite name on this list, is shared by four lucky dogs. Those who enjoy trademark infringement may consider “Oreo,” which is shared by five males and one female.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what else do we know about these dogs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For starters, they are slightly more likely to be male, and both males and females (that are registered with DC) are very likely to be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/dogs_registered_mf.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have a great chance of being some breed of terrier. More than a third of registered dogs is some kind of terrier or mix. The most common breed variety in DC is the Terrier / Pit Bull mix, with 233 registrants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogs in DC are also on the younger side, as on this chart (measured in people years).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/dog_years_dc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data on who the dogs are in DC comes from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/tree/master/Registered%20Dogs&quot;&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; FOIA’d and compiled by the great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.datalensdc.com/&quot;&gt;Kate Rabinowitz&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this has been a good excuse for you to go out and pet a pup!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <id>http://localhost:4000/2017/03/20/ncaa-rd1</id>
      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2017/03/20/ncaa-rd1/">&lt;p&gt;Ah, March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a time of bright &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/noreaster-shuts-down-travel-threatens-to-unleash-blizzard-conditions-in-at-least-8-states/70001093&quot;&gt;spring sunshine&lt;/a&gt;, cherry blossoms, and people everywhere searching their memories for where exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University&quot; title=&quot;Cincinnati&quot;&gt;Xavier University&lt;/a&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s tournament season! Or at least it is every year in my household until UNC loses. But beyond my general interest in watching a round ball go through a hoop, it’s also a great time to test out predictions. Since everyone and their brother makes predictions about who is likely to win the games each round, I thought I’d check and see how they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do that, I simulated the projections from data scientists at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/bracketology/&quot;&gt;CBS Sports&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://sports.yahoo.com/m/66607537-5012-36a0-8694-65a0522cf6c1/ss_2017-ncaa-tournament-bracket.html&quot;&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;, data &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-march-madness-predictions/&quot;&gt;blog 538&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology&quot;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;, college basketball stat-tracker &lt;a href=&quot;http://kenpom.com/&quot;&gt;Ken Pomeroy&lt;/a&gt;, and sports handicapper &lt;a href=&quot;http://sagarin.com/sports/cbsend.htm&quot;&gt;Jeff Sagarin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I collected the percentage likelihoods for each of the rounds from where they were compiled at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/13/upshot/ncaa-bracket-super-table.html&quot;&gt;NY Times Upshot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;details&gt;&amp;lt;summary&amp;gt;More methodology&amp;lt;/summary&amp;gt; I then created a simulator that used the projections given, and for each school, simulated 5,000 iterations of each team’s probability. I compiled the results of these simulations into an overall projection that differs very slightly (and randomly) from the average of the range of probability projections from a school.&lt;/details&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the first round of the tournament is 64 hours of basketball shoved into a two-day period, it’s often the most exciting period, and the best for analyzing predictions. So I compiled the results of the first round and compared the scores for each team to the prior prediction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the graph below demonstrates, these results split out into four groups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;: teams that are performing as advertised; they were supposed to win, and they did win&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upsets&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the reason we watch March Madness; these are the teams that weren’t supposed to win, and then they do. The farther to the left they appear, the more surprising it was.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shockers&lt;/strong&gt;: this is where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/piccolo-tears-are-the-saddest-tears-1692898303&quot;&gt;crying&lt;/a&gt; happens; these teams were supposed to win, but lost. Brutal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Made-the-Dancers&lt;/strong&gt;: where it was an honor just to be nominated, but nobody expected them to win, and they didn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/NCAA_rd1_labeled.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we move into the second weekend of the tournament, I’ll keep taking a look at how these predictions held up. There are some early upsets. Last year’s champ Villanova have already lost this year. I felt bad for them for exactly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMHoGRp1QrE&quot;&gt;4.7 seconds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
