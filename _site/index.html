          <p>Let’s say you’re at a local dog park in DC, and you see a dog chasing a ball, doing dog things, and you want to call out for her to come play with you. What should you yell?</p>

<p>Try “Lady” or “Blue.”</p>

<p>According to a list of 1,533 dog registrations in the District in 2016, those are most likely names for female and male dogs, respectively. Here are other common pup names.</p>

<p>Rambo, my favorite name on this list, is shared by four lucky dogs. Those who enjoy trademark infringement may consider “Oreo,” which is shared by five males and one female.</p>

<p>So what else do we know about these dogs?</p>

<p>For starters, they are slightly more likely to be male, and both males and females (that are registered with DC) are very likely to be fixed.</p>

<p><img src="../images/dogs_registered_mf.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>They also have a great chance of being some breed of terrier. More than a third of registered dogs is some kind of terrier or mix. The most common breed variety in DC is the Terrier / Pit Bull mix, with 233 registrants.</p>

<p>Dogs in DC are also on the younger side, as on this chart (measured in people years).</p>

<p><img src="../images/dog_years_dc.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The data on who the dogs are in DC comes from a <a href="https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests/tree/master/Registered%20Dogs">dataset</a> FOIA’d and compiled by the great <a href="http://www.datalensdc.com/">Kate Rabinowitz</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this has been a good excuse for you to go out and pet a pup!</p>

          <p>Ah, March.</p>

<p>It’s a time of bright <a href="http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/noreaster-shuts-down-travel-threatens-to-unleash-blizzard-conditions-in-at-least-8-states/70001093">spring sunshine</a>, cherry blossoms, and people everywhere searching their memories for where exactly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University" title="Cincinnati">Xavier University</a> is.</p>

<p>It’s tournament season! Or at least it is every year in my household until UNC loses. But beyond my general interest in watching a round ball go through a hoop, it’s also a great time to test out predictions. Since everyone and their brother makes predictions about who is likely to win the games each round, I thought I’d check and see how they are doing.</p>

<p>To do that, I simulated the projections from data scientists at <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/bracketology/">CBS Sports</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/m/66607537-5012-36a0-8694-65a0522cf6c1/ss_2017-ncaa-tournament-bracket.html">Yahoo!</a>, data <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2017-march-madness-predictions/">blog 538</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology">ESPN</a>, college basketball stat-tracker <a href="http://kenpom.com/">Ken Pomeroy</a>, and sports handicapper <a href="http://sagarin.com/sports/cbsend.htm">Jeff Sagarin</a>.</p>

<p>I collected the percentage likelihoods for each of the rounds from where they were compiled at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/13/upshot/ncaa-bracket-super-table.html">NY Times Upshot</a>. <details>&lt;summary&gt;More methodology&lt;/summary&gt; I then created a simulator that used the projections given, and for each school, simulated 5,000 iterations of each team’s probability. I compiled the results of these simulations into an overall projection that differs very slightly (and randomly) from the average of the range of probability projections from a school.</details></p>

<p>Since the first round of the tournament is 64 hours of basketball shoved into a two-day period, it’s often the most exciting period, and the best for analyzing predictions. So I compiled the results of the first round and compared the scores for each team to the prior prediction.</p>

<p>As the graph below demonstrates, these results split out into four groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Favorites</strong>: teams that are performing as advertised; they were supposed to win, and they did win</li>
  <li><strong>Upsets</strong>: this is the reason we watch March Madness; these are the teams that weren’t supposed to win, and then they do. The farther to the left they appear, the more surprising it was.</li>
  <li><strong>Shockers</strong>: this is where the <a href="http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/piccolo-tears-are-the-saddest-tears-1692898303">crying</a> happens; these teams were supposed to win, but lost. Brutal.</li>
  <li><strong>Made-the-Dancers</strong>: where it was an honor just to be nominated, but nobody expected them to win, and they didn’t.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../assets/NCAA_rd1_labeled.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As we move into the second weekend of the tournament, I’ll keep taking a look at how these predictions held up. There are some early upsets. Last year’s champ Villanova have already lost this year. I felt bad for them for exactly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMHoGRp1QrE">4.7 seconds</a>.</p>
