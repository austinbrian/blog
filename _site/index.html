        <div class="post-content">
          <p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) has been around since 2011. The organization is charged with policing financial services companies to ensure that they are fairly treating consumers. One of the ways they gather information on consumers’ experiences is by tallying complaints of wrongdoing against companies.</p>

<p>And for Donald Trump’s Inauguration Day, there were more complaints to the CFPB than there have been on any other day.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/Total_cfpb_complaints_5_24.png" alt="" title="That orange spike there is You-Know-Who" /></p>

<p>While complaints have increased steadily over the CFPB’s existence, the 24 hours before Trump’s inauguration saw more than twice as many reports to the CFPB as any preceding day. There were more than 1,500 individual complaints on both Inauguration Day and the day before it.</p>

<p>The CFPB houses a massive amount of data in its <a href="https://data.consumerfinance.gov/dataset/Consumer-Complaints/s6ew-h6mp">complaints database</a>, which is open (and uses an exceptionally well-documented <a href="https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.consumerfinance.gov/jhzv-w97w">API, courtesy of Socrata</a>). One particularly interesting way  that this data lines up is around various types of products that people have complained about. For instance, over the course of the CFPB’s existence, mortgages and debt collection have been the two top issues that consumers have complaints about.</p>

<p>But on Inauguration Day, more than 60% of complaints were about student loans.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/obama_trump_prod_complaints.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m especially interested in how these complaints demonstrate the ways people talk about their mistreatments, and the way those translate to actions. I’ll be pursuing those questions in the following days as part of a larger project.</p>

          <p>Institutions of higher education are constantly comparing themselves to one another, and one of the ways they do so is using their total amount of funding dollars.</p>

<p>But total amount of funding is, at best, a blunt instrument. The National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (part of the National Science Foundation) releases an annual survey of these research dollars, and breaks them down <a href="https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/herd/2015/">all sorts of ways</a>, including <a href="https://ncsesdata.nsf.gov/herd/2015/html/HERD2015_DST_18.html">by field</a>.
<br /></p>

<h3>Data</h3>

<p>This table is a selection of the 640 universities that responded to the survey for 2015. <em>Rank</em> indicates the university’s relative positioning to other institutions in terms of total research funding. Johns Hopkins has the most funding, and comes in with nearly twice as much as the next-highest institution (the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor).</p>

<p>The other variable names correspond with research funding received by various fields in 2015 (<em>measured in thousands of dollars</em>).</p>

<h3>Initial Exploration</h3>

<p>I wanted to look beyond these total figures and see how unsupervised machine learning would classify these schools compared to one another. I started by examining total research dollars for various sets of fields against one another. Scatter plots are a useful way to see that information. Here, darker points indicate greater total research dollars.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/es_engineering_rd.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most plots that are highly clustered around 0, with bands of institutions fanning out. In some cases, such as engineering, institutions with a greater concentration of students are outliers, but don’t necessarily show a high degree of difference between them.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/psy_lifesci_rd.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Psychology and Life Sciences, however, have a data distribution that allow us to see some of the spread of data, which makes them a decent place to start visualizing the way some of these schools might cluster together.
<br /></p>

<h3>Density clustering</h3>

<p>These data points seem relatively tightly grouped, and I’ll start with DBSCAN, a density-based clustering algorithm that accounts for noise as part of its algorithm. <em>For an exceptional visualization of DBSCAN, check out <a href="https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/">Naftali Harris’s blog</a>.</em></p>

<p>I’ll use the same plot of Psychology vs Life Sciences that looked promising before, but colorized by the clusters that DBSCAN assigns.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/psy_lifsci_dbscan.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yikes. This only shows 2-3 clusters, and they don’t seem to be particularly useful in describing the data. It doesn’t look particularly good, but eyeballing it isn’t always a great way to determine the usefulness of unsupervised learning algorithms, so I’ll check the numbers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Estimated number of clusters:</strong> 3, as we could <em>just</em> make out <br /></li>
  <li><strong>Homogeneity:</strong> 0.114<br />
    <ul>
      <li>Ouch - our clusters heavily overlap with one another; the best score is 1</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> 1.000 <br />
    <ul>
      <li>All the members of a given class are in the same cluster - this is to be expected since we have such unbalanced classes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>V-measure:</strong> 0.205 <br />
    <ul>
      <li>The harmonic mean between homogeneity and completeness, higher is better</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Silhouette Coefficient:</strong> -0.074 <br />
    <ul>
      <li>This score shows how distinct clusters are from one another. Scores near zero indicate overlapping clusters (<em>bad</em>) and negative scores indicate incorrect clustering (<em>worse</em>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>So on the whole, this doesn’t seem like a very good algorithm to use. The data is too dense on the whole to create unique cluster values.
<br /></p>

<h3>Hierarchical clustering</h3>
<p>To improve our approach, it would be useful to be able to see how many clusters we would have at various levels. Fortunately, there is a useful approach called hierarchical clustering that builds agglomerative groupings as data points are more similar to one another.</p>

<p>This results in a tree-type diagram that shows the “distance” (here measured in research dollars) between two data points.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/dendrogram_he_rd.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>On first inspection, there look to be a couple of good places to break up our clusters.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If we want a very simple way to break down groups, we could still break it at ~$1.5 million, which would separate into three total groups, though one would include far more data points than the other. This is basically what the DBSCAN algorithm did.</li>
  <li>We could do it at around $1,000,000, which would break up the green data points into two groups, and would break up the red grouping into what appears to be four clusters.</li>
  <li>For more granularity, a break point at $500,000 appears to create around 10 clusters, though the distinction is hard to see with this diagram.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the purposes of grouping schools together, I think that middle class of clusters is going to create the most useful separation, so I’ll create clusters at the $1,000,000 mark.</p>

<p>And here is what the Psychology vs Life Sciences plot looks like, with different colors indicating cluster groupings.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/psy_lifsci_clustered.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Hey! It looks like there are distinct bands of colors in there! This looks like something we can use to better understand how universities are different. Let’s look at one more.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/es_life_sci_clustered.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Again, a useful banding, and one that is more prominent for the Life Sciences dimension than for the Environmental Sciences one.</p>

<p>Not all the comparisons will look as robust, but that’s part of why the clustering itself is good - this can be difficult to eyeball.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/math_cs_clustered.png" alt="" />
<br /></p>

<h3>Final cluster insights</h3>

<p>Below I have included a table of the final cluster groups. The big takeaway is that Johns Hopkins receives so much R&amp;D funding that it stands alone as an institution. It is a cluster unto itself. It is the übercluster.</p>

<p>The next cluster includes a number of state universities, many of which fund a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/austinbrian.github.io/master/assets/UNCCH_budget.png" title="23% in 2012 at UNC-Chapel Hill">significant portion of their operating budgets</a> from federal grant money.</p>

<p>The next group of institutions includes a dozen largely technical institutions or large medical centers (as well as the University of California - Berkeley). Following that are smaller research-focused institutions, then larger institutions with less research focus, and finally a large group of primarily access-oriented institutions.</p>

<p><em>A detailed walkthrough of this analysis is available on my <a href="https://github.com/austinbrian/DSI-labs/blob/master/Higher%20Ed%20R%26D%20Analysis.ipynb">github</a>, with a more reader-friendly view on <a href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/austinbrian/DSI-labs/blob/master/Higher%20Ed%20R%26D%20Analysis.ipynb">NBViewer</a>.</em></p>

<p>Here is a full list of the way these clusters break out.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>In 2017, the primary way most citizens interact with their government is through the internet. Before they go to an office in person, before they write a letter or make a call, they visit a website. As such, the traffic across those webpages present a useful window into the way people interact with their government, and into the rhythms of American life.</p>

<p>To understand how traffic preferences have changed during the first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency, I pulled data on a month’s worth of traffic among all US government websites from <a href="https://analytics.usa.gov/">analytics.usa.gov</a>. The website compiles statistics for the prior 30 days (or 5 minutes, if you’re interested in that). To compare the way activities have changed, I compared data of the prior 30 days that included Trump’s inauguration (the most readily-available data was for Jan. 29th, nine days after his inauguration) and from his 100th day in office, April 29th.</p>

<p>This chart demonstrates the way views of government domains were different in April from the way they were in January. It uses a “ranking” of the number of visits a domain received.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/pagerank.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Beyond the number of visits (which determines ranking), I considered the number of pageviews a domain received over that time, as well as the number of unique users. For some pages, such as <a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/">USAjobs.gov</a>, the number of pageviews relatively high, so there is some difference in that analysis. I’ve summarized some of the bigger differences in this analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Big Gainers</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>IRS websites are big gainers, since the first 100 days always<a href="http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/04/15/321414/index.htm" title="Well, since 1921. Tax Day began with passage of the 16th Amendment in 1913, but was collected March 1st, before Woodrow Wilson's inauguration on March 4th of 1913. It moved to March 15th in 1918, where it remained until 1955, when it moved again to the day we know, April 15th.">*</a> coincides with <a href="https://austinbrian.github.io/2017/04/18/pres_counties/">Tax Day</a> in America. The main IRS web domain saw the greatest increase in total visits among all executive branch domains</li>
  <li>NASA’s images domain saw the biggest growth in visitors over January, with more than 100x the visitors in the month of April as they had in January. During that time the probe Cassini crossed through the rings of Saturn and sent back stunning photos.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://sec.gov">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> includes databases that house information on publicly-traded company quarterly filings. Since the period included the end of the first fiscal quarter for many companies, it may be unsurprising that visits to the website increased 83% between the two periods.</li>
  <li>Visits to the White House’s <a href="https://www.stopbullying.gov/" title="the cyber">anti-cyberbullying initiative</a> jumped by 184% between January and April.</li>
  <li>The 100-day marker is right before many deadlines for students applying to college to receive student aid packages, which may be why pageviews of the National Postsecondary Student Aid Survey domain increased by a greater percentage than any other government domain over the period.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Big Losah’s</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The White House’s main website, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/">whitehouse.gov</a> plummeted in popularity between January and April. It tumbled from being the 9th most popular federal web domain to the 22nd, with 13 million fewer visitors over the 30-day period. Corresponding visits to <a href="https://search.whitehouse.gov">search.whitehouse.gov</a> fell similarly.</li>
  <li>Similarly, <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">petitions to</a> the White House fell precipitously, losing 13 rank positions and 3 million fewer visits in April than they did in January.</li>
  <li>The state department’s <a href="https://ceac.state.gov">web domain</a> that details a foreign traveler’s passport status saw a drop of more than 2 million visitors between the two months.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://opm.gov">Office of Personnel Management</a> - which DC-based folks know as the people who tell you whether the government is shut down due to snow - became much less popular in April than it was in January.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Top Government Websites</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>People always want their packages and they want to know the weather, so the domains for the <a href="https://tools.usps.com">post office</a> and the <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov">weather forecast</a> are consistently some of the top website. These domains are also common API targets for mobile apps that involve weather and delivery.</li>
  <li><a href="https://usajobs.gov">USAjobs.gov</a> is the main federal government portal for job applicants, and is one of the top ten websites in both months.</li>
  <li>The Centers for Disease Control was popular in both January and April, as was the Social Security Administration.</li>
</ul>

<p>To summarize, Americans are busy living their lives, but they are quantifiably are less interested in interacting with the public-facing part of the executive than they were at the beginning of the Trump Era.</p>

          </h1>

        <div class="post-content">
          <p>If you took all 3,113 counties in the United States, and wanted to try and guess whether a county would cast more votes for Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, the most important pieces of information to have be the number of people who claim an education-related deduction or credit.</p>

<p>This finding on student loans is part of my ongoing analysis of the intersection of 2016 voting behavior and tax return information.</p>

<details><summary>More methodology</summary>
This analysis was performed using a random forest classifier, which used 124 variables drawn from county-level 2014 IRS data. Variables included aggregate totals and participant counts for each income type and deduction. The dataset was matched by county with the New York Times report of election night votes. Average cross-validated accuracy score using the model's classification was approximately 0.89 (good!) and an F1 score of 0.88 (not bad!).
</details>
<p><br />
To be sure, these groups of voters are qualitatively different in other measurable ways. For instance, the number of farm returns in a county is the next-most impactful feature in the income dataset behind education credits and deductions. Counties with the highest numbers of these returns were the most likely in the data to cast more returns for Trump than Clinton.</p>

<p>But these findings largely conform to the behaviors we might expect of the electorate. Those with higher levels of education (especially those at high-cost liberal arts colleges) are most likely to inhabit counties that vote for Clinton. Farmers were more likely to vote Trump.</p>

<p>Perhaps more interesting are the distinctions that weren’t found in the dataset. Most importantly, total taxable income did not emerge as an especially valuable predictor.
<br /></p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/austinbrian/blog/master/images/agi_pp_vs_clinton.png" alt="" />
<br /></p>

<p>The figure above demonstrates the distribution of income, as separated by Clinton’s margin over Trump (or vice versa). Each blue dot represents a county in which more people voted for Clinton than Trump, and each red dot shows a county with more Trump votes.</p>

<p>While the sheer numbers for the Trump voters are significantly greater - Trump won about 84 percent of US counties - the distribution of incomes is relatively similar between them.</p>

          <p>Happy (?) Tax Day, everyone.</p>

<p>In honor of Tax Day, I wanted to do a small piece of analysis on the way taxpayers voted in the 2016 election. Here are a couple of brief headlines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hillary Clinton won among those who filed tax returns in 2015.</li>
  <li>Donald Trump won the vast majority of counties, winning 2,623 counties to Clinton’s 490, or about 84%.</li>
  <li>Of the counties that had the highest proportion of votes for independent candidates, 12 of the top 15 are in Utah (the other three are in Idaho), likely a function of the independent candidacy of Evan McMullin, a member of the Mormon church in Utah.</li>
  <li>Counties with the highest total gross income per capita include a small town of 499 voters in Texas called McMullen, of whom Trump won 454 votes. Manhattan, NY also cracks the top 3, and voted for Clinton with 87 percent of the vote.</li>
  <li>The poorest counties also voted heavily for Clinton. Three counties on South Dakota reservations, and one county in Mississippi all voted for her by margins of at least 3-to-1.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a graphic of the overall margin by county, according to data on county-level vote from the New York <em>Times</em>.</p>

<iframe width="1000" height="1000" src="https://public.tableau.com/views/Clinton-TrumpMarginbyCounty/Story1?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>A short note on methodology and assumptions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Income calculations is based on IRS <a href="https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-county-data">county-level data</a> from taxes filed for the year 2014 (those typically due by April 15, 2015).</li>
  <li>Taxpayer-level calculations were conducted by assuming that within a county, taxpayers and non-taxpayers voted at the same rate. Thus, to find the number of taxpayers voting for Clinton within a county, this analysis multiplied Clinton’s margin in that county by the total number of tax returns for the county.</li>
