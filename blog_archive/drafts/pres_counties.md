Happy (?) Tax Day, everyone.

In honor of Tax Day, I wanted to do a small piece of analysis on the way taxpayers voted in the 2016 election. Here are a couple of brief headlines:
* Hillary Clinton won among those who filed tax returns in 2015.
* Donald Trump won the vast majority of counties, winning 2,623 counties to Clinton's 490. 

Here is a graphic of the overall margin by county, according to data on county-level vote from the New York *Times*.

A short note on methodology and assumptions:
-  Income calculations is based on IRS [county-level data](https://www.irs.gov/uac/soi-tax-stats-county-data) from taxes filed for the year 2014 (those typically due by April 15, 2015).
- Taxpayer-level calculations were conducted by assuming that within a county, taxpayers and non-taxpayers voted at the same rate. Thus, to find the number of taxpayers voting for Clinton within a county, this analysis multiplied Clinton's margin in that county by the total number of tax returns for the county.
